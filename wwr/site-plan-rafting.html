        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Mexico is an awesome place where you can find beautiful winding rivers. One of those is  the Tampaon River. The purpose of this site is to introduce our company as one of the bests companies to give you a unique service and of safe water rafting on this river..</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This has great Experience been made up for all of the members of the family. Younger kids, roughly 5-9 years old, are best suited for river trips that last up to 3 hours on the water and some are better with shorter spans of 1-2 hours. Each child, of course, is different and able to focus and enjoy for different periods of time. Kids that are 10 years old and up to early teens seem to be able to handle full day trips with 3-5 or more hours of river time. Middle teens and up should be able to enjoy long days on the river and overnight river rafting trips. The thrill of white water rafting has been designed to go on a group tour down the Tampaon River. After comfortable transfer to the starting point, listen to a safety briefing from your guide. Begin with a gentle ride along calm water, while you take in the surrounding scenery. Then let the excitement take hold as you maneuver down the Class III rapids. Afterwards, a much deserved lunch is served riverside.</p>
