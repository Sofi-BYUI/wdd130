                    <strong>Rafting on the Meco River:</strong>
                    Fun and challenging Class III River (moderate risk) originating at the El Salto and El Meco waterfalls. This river has the necessary force to be navigated only during the summer (rainy season). It has fun rapids during the tour with waves and waterfalls. We begin from the ‚Äúejido‚Äù (portion of land) El Meco. This river of travertine rock, and surrounded by trees allows us to enjoy the ride and at the same time admire the natural landscape, to end in the village of El Naranjo, where we will taste delicious regional dishes.
