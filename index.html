        <p> Hello, my name is Sofia Enid Sanchez Arzaluz. I am from Pachuca Hidalgo Mexico. I love dancing (I practiced it from ages 6-18. at the "Centro de las artes del estado de Hidalgo"), playing basketball (I trained it from ages 12-19 I was part of my high school's team and others.), playing ping pong and pretty much everything active. On the other side, I also like hanging out with friends, spending time with family, math and learning new things. My favorite color is coral-pink. My favorite food is Mexican Tacos!. My favorite drink is orange juice. </p>
        <p>This is my first "web design" class. I do not know anything about this or programming, but I am excited about learning. I Currently live in South Jordan Utah. I moved here 8 months ago. I did it because I am also studying english at "American One English Schools". I came back from my mission 1 year ago. I served in the Mexico Villahermosa mission. I am the first one of 2 children. </p>
        <p> My favorite scripture is: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and cdeny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God." (Moroni 10:32)  </p>

        <img src="images/pachuca-mexico.jpg" alt="Pachuca Hidalgo Mexico">
        <p>known as Pachuca de Soto, is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Hidalgo. It is located in the south-central part of the state. Pachuca is located about 90 kilometres (56 mi) from Mexico City via Mexican Federal Highway 85. There is no consensus about the origin of the name Pachuca. It has been traced to the word pachoa (strait; opening), Pachoacan (place of government; place of silver and gold), and patlachuican (place of factories; place of tears).</p>    </aside>
